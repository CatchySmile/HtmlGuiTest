# HTML GUI Test

[Preview](https://catchysmile.github.io/HtmlGuiTest/)

This project is a demonstration of a customizable and interactive HTML-based GUI. It features movable UI components, toggleable dark mode, and various interactive elements such as buttons and links. It is all based within a single .html file as a challenge to myself. This project was largely inspired by the look of a stereotypical Minecraft hacked clients UI.

## Features

- **Movable UI Components**: Drag and reposition various boxes and elements on the page.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes with a single button.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Buttons for downloading files, opening links, and other actions.
- **Expandable Content**: Show more or less content dynamically to showcase news or other information.
- **Custom Animations**: Self explanatory.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the GUI.
- **CSS**: Styling and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity and dynamic behavior.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Interact with the various UI components:
   - Drag boxes to reposition them.
   - Click buttons to perform actions like downloading files or opening links.
   - Toggle dark mode using the "Toggle dark mode" button.
   - Expand or collapse content.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the structure, styles, and scripts.
- `files/`: Directory for downloadable files (e.g., `example.txt`).
